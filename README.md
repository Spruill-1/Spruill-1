Hi, I'm David Spruill - a core Windows dev at Microsoft where I work on display technologies.

I'm primarily a C/C++/C# dev, although I'm working on picking up Rust.

I'm happy to talk about the Windows display stack, and in my off time I am usually playing with some embedded systems or simple Arduino project.
